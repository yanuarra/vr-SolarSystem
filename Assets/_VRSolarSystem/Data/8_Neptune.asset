  planetDesc: "Dark, cold and whipped by supersonic winds, giant Neptune is the eighth
    and most distant major planet orbiting our Sun. More than 30 times as far from
    the Sun as Earth, Neptune is not visible to the naked eye. In 2011, Neptune completed
    its first 165-year orbit since its discovery.\r\n\r\nThe planet\u2019s rich blue
    color comes from methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red wavelengths of
    light, but allows blue ones to be reflected back into space.\r\n\r\nNeptune was
    the first planet located through mathematical calculations. Using predictions
    sent to him by French astronomer Urbain Le Verrier, based on disturbances in
    the orbit of Uranus, German astronomer Johann Galle was the first to observe
    the planet in 1846. The planet is named after the Roman god of the sea, as suggested
    by Le Verrier."
